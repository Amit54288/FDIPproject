Fire Detection Image Classification (PyTorch)
This project implements a binary image classification model to detect Fire vs No Fire using transfer learning with ResNet18. The model is trained and validated using PyTorch with data augmentation and learning rate scheduling.

Key Highlights:
Used pretrained ResNet18 for transfer learning and fine-tuning
Applied image preprocessing and augmentation (resize, rotation, flip, normalization)
Implemented training and validation pipelines with Adam optimizer and CrossEntropy loss
Visualized training loss and validation accuracy over epochs

Tech Stack:
Python
PyTorch, Torchvision
ResNet18 (Transfer Learning)
Google Colab
